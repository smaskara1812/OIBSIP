        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Albert Einstein was a revolutionary physicist whose theory of relativity transformed our understanding of space, time, and energy. Born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, Einstein exhibited an early interest in science and mathematics. His passion for theoretical physics led to groundbreaking contributions that challenged existing paradigms.</p>
        <p>Einstein’s work on the photoelectric effect demonstrated that light could be understood as quanta of energy, which provided critical support for quantum theory. His famous equation, E=mc², established a fundamental relationship between mass and energy, which became a cornerstone of modern physics.</p>
        <p>In addition to his scientific achievements, Einstein was a committed advocate for peace, civil rights, and intellectual freedom. He moved to the United States in 1933 to escape the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany and spent the remainder of his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire and influence the fields of physics and beyond. His contributions to science and humanity remain profound and enduring.</p>
